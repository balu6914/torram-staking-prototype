# Torram Staking Prototype

This repository contains the prototype for staking Runes (or BTC as a placeholder) on a custom Cosmos SDK blockchain called **Torram**. The goal is to create a decentralized application that allows staking and unstaking of assets (Runes/BTC) on the Cosmos SDK chain, with transactional information being visible on both the Cosmos SDK chain and the Bitcoin network.

## Overview

The **Torram Staking Prototype** aims to create a seamless interaction between the Bitcoin network and the Cosmos SDK chain. The prototype allows users to stake Runes (or BTC in this case) and track the staked assets across both networks. Upon unstaking, the status of the transaction is reflected in both networks as well.

Key features:
- **Staking and Unstaking** of assets (Runes/BTC).
- **Real-time synchronization** of asset data between Cosmos SDK and Bitcoin networks.
- **Custom Cosmos SDK message types** (e.g., `MsgUnstake`) for handling staking/unstaking transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your machine:

- **Go** (v1.23.5 or higher)
- **Node.js** (for any additional services or front-end integration, if applicable)
- **Cosmos SDK** (v0.50.11, installed via Starport)
- **Starport CLI** for scaffolding Cosmos SDK chains

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balu6914/torram-staking-prototype.git
cd torram-staking-prototype
```

2. Install required dependencies for the Cosmos SDK chain:

```bash
cd cosmos-sdk
make install
```

3. Initialize the Torram chain using Starport:

```bash
cd torram
starport scaffold chain github.com/balu6914/torram
```

4. Modify `types.go` and `tx.pb.go` files to define staking/unstaking messages, and ensure Cosmos SDK correctly recognizes custom message types.

5. Define the custom signers and implement the `DefineCustomGetSigners` method in the `runestaking` module to handle the `MsgUnstake` transaction message.

### Running the Blockchain

To start the chain:

```bash
starport chain serve
```

This will launch the chain, and you can interact with it using Cosmos SDK commands or build out additional interfaces for front-end or API communication.

```

## Usage

Once the chain is running, you can interact with it via Cosmos SDK CLI or custom transaction messages. For staking and unstaking, you’ll typically send messages of type `MsgStake` and `MsgUnstake` to the blockchain.

Example (using Cosmos SDK CLI):

```bash
cosmosd tx runestaking unstake [AMOUNT] [ASSET] --from [SENDER]
```

Where:
- `[AMOUNT]` is the amount of the asset to unstake (e.g., "100").
- `[ASSET]` is the type of asset being unstaked (e.g., "BTC" or "Runes").
- `[SENDER]` is the address of the account performing the transaction.

## Dependencies

- **Cosmos SDK** v0.50.11
- **Go** v1.23.5
- **Starport CLI** (v28.7.0)
- **Bitcoin Go Library** (for BTC integration)
